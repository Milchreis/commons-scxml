                         Commons  SCXML Package
                             Version 0.5
                            Release Notes


INTRODUCTION:

The Commons SCXML (State Chart XML) project provides a generic
state-machine based execution environment. It borrows most semantics
from its namesake Working Draft at the W3C. Anything that can be
represented as a UML state chart -- business process flows, view
navigation bits, interaction or dialog management, and many more -- can
leverage the Commons SCXML library. The library abstracts out the
environment interfaces, and can be used in numerous server-side and
client-side runtimes.

API STABILITY:

The initial release version number has been chosen to be 0.5 (rather
than a 1.0). This is meant to better convey the fact that the underlying
W3C specification is still a Working Draft, and subsequent changes to
the Draft may warrant changes to portions of the library API. The core
Commons SCXML APIs (SCXMLDigester, SCXMLExecutor etc.) are stable.
Portions such as processing of <datamodel> and <invoke> SCXML elements,
on the other hand, are subject to change as further changes are expected
in these sections of the W3C Working Draft. See Working Draft for
details.
