                         Commons SCXML Package
                             Version 0.6
                            Release Notes

INTRODUCTION:

Commons SCXML 0.6 primarily contains new features, along with a
handful of bug fixes. See about section below for general information
on Commons SCXML.

IMPORTANT NOTES:

 o Commons SCXML v0.6 requires Commons Digester v1.8 (mandatory update)

 o The recommended version of Commons JEXL is now v1.1 and the
   recommended version of Commons Logging is v1.1

 o Starting v0.6, all SCXML elements must strictly belong to the
   correct namespace with the following URI (case sensitive):

    http://www.w3.org/2005/07/scxml

NEW FEATURES:

 o The entire Commons SCXML object model as well as the SCXMLExecutor
   instances are now serializable. This is particularly useful in
   web environments for session persistence and clustering.

 o There is improved support for XML namespaces in SCXML documents.
   Custom actions may be defined in user-specified namespaces.

 o Deferred XPath expression evaluation, in context of interaction with
   <data> elements, has improved. It is now possible to use namespace
   prefixed XPath expressions based on prefixes used in the document.

 o The SCXMLExecutor instances now provide some element of thread-safety.
   Firing events on a state machine executor instance or reseting it
   are synchronized operations. The underlying state machine needs to
   model any race conditions correctly.

DEPRECATIONS:

All deprecations introduced in this version are scheduled for removal in
v1.0 of the library.

 o [org.apache.commons.scxml.io.SCXMLDigester] The custom digester rules
   in this class are deprecated. They should not have been part of the
   public API to begin with.

 o [org.apache.commons.scxml.ErrorReporter] All String constants in this
   class have been deprecated. Use constants with the same names in
   org.apache.commons.scxml.semantics.ErrorConstants instead.

 o [org.apache.commons.scxml.model.Invoke] The method getParams()
   returning a java.util.Map has been deprecated. Use the method
   params() returning a java.util.List instead. See Javadocs for details.

BUG FIXES:

 o [SCXML-21] Delay is not processed for <send> element with default
   "targettype".

 o [SCXML-14] Allow target of a transition to be omitted.

OTHER CHANGES:

 o [SCXML-31] <var> and <assign> now log new values.

ABOUT COMMONS SCXML:

The Commons SCXML (State Chart XML) project provides a generic
state-machine based execution environment. It borrows most semantics
from its namesake Working Draft at the W3C. Anything that can be
represented as a UML state chart -- business process flows, view
navigation bits, interaction or dialog management, and many more -- can
leverage the Commons SCXML library. The library abstracts out the
environment interfaces, and can be used in numerous server-side and
client-side runtimes.
