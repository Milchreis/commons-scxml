 <section name="Commons SCXML">

  <p>
  The first <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/scxml/">Working Draft of State 
  Chart XML (SCXML)</a> was published by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
  Voice Browser Working Group in July 2005.
  SCXML provides a generic state-machine based execution environment based on Harel
  State Tables. SCXML is a candidate for the control language within 
  multiple markup languages coming out of the W3C (see Working Draft for details).
  <em>Commons SCXML</em> is an implementation aimed at creating
  and maintaining a Java SCXML engine capable of executing a state machine defined 
  using a SCXML document, while abstracting out the environment interfaces.
  </p>
  <p>
  The use cases for an SCXML engine are multiple and varied. Anything that can be
  represented as a UML state chart -- business process flows, view navigation bits,
  interaction or dialog management, and many more -- can leverage an SCXML engine
  library.
