   <i>Q: Whats a library without usecases?</i><br/>
   <i>A:</i>
  </p>

  <subsection name="Introduction">
   <p>
   There are numerous use cases for an engine like Commons SCXML. Any process
   that can be represented as a UML state chart, for example, business process 
   flows, view navigation bits, interaction or dialog management etc. (this is,
   by no means, a comprehensive list), can leverage the Commons SCXML engine
   library. We illustrate just a few sample usecases within frameworks in the
   open source community as illustrations.
