  <section name="Commons SCXML - Standalone testing, trying out samples">

   <p>The SCXML distribution provides a utility class 
   <code>org.apache.commons.scxml.env.jsp.Standalone</code> which provides
   a mock environment allowing users to try out samples. The core dependencies
   for Commons SCXML are Commons Digester (which introduces a transitive 
   dependency on Commons BeanUtils, at the least) and Commons Logging. In 
   addition, an environment specific expression language is used in SCXML 
   documents. The Standalone class anticipates expressions in the JSP 2.0 
   Expression Language, and hence requires commons-el.jar and jsp-api.jar. 
   View the <a href="../dependencies.html">dependencies</a> page for the
   recommended version numbers. <i>It may be possible to use lower version
   numbers for the Commons dependencies.</i>
   </p>

   <p>So that amounts to (use the correct local paths and filenames to the
   <code>jar</code> files and the SCXML document, without the line breaks):</p>

   <pre>
   java -classpath

   commons-digester-1.7.jar;commons-beanutils-1.7.0.jar;
   commons-logging-1.0.4.jar;commons-scxml-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar;
   commons-el-1.0.jar;jsp-api-2.0.jar

   org.apache.commons.scxml.env.jsp.Standalone 

   microwave01.xml
   </pre>

   <p>You could set up something more elegant (a script, an ant task etc.),
   but that is what it boils down to.
   If the document is a well-formed SCXML document, you will be able to 
   type ? or help at the console and you can follow the directions thereafter 
   (to simulate events, set variable values, reset the state machine or quit).
   </p>

   <p>A few examples are available as part of the 
   <a href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/jakarta/commons/sandbox/scxml/trunk/src/test/java/org/apache/commons/scxml/">
   Commons SCXML test suite</a>.</p>
